<h2>Quantum Programming Projects</h2>
<div class="section group">
    <div class="col span_1_of_3 proj-box">
        <h3>Quantum Compilers and Circuit Optimization</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">While working as an intern at Rigetti Computing, I was tasked with working on the compiler and optimizer which processes <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355">Quil</a> code, which then gets executed on Rigetti's quantum computers. This was a fun challenge for me, which involved thinking about and implementing control flow graph optimization, dead code elimination, quantum gate fusion, and algorithmic techniques for making the quantum virtual machine faster. The project also taught me about the usage of Common Lisp.</p>
        <p class="proj-info">Writeup and more info coming soon!</p>

        <h3>FPGA Programming for NV Centers</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">Using a high-level FPGA programming interface, this project is geared toward the creation of a tool set for generating conditional pulse sequences. These pulse sequences will be used for nitrogen-vacancy center initialization and Rabi oscillations. See the papers section for more details.</p>

        <h3>Neural Network for NV-Center Classification</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">Using a neural network made with TensorFlow, and a small set of training data consisting of spectrum scans of possible nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we were able to decide with decent accuracy whether or not the given scan was characteristic of a Nitrogen-vacancy center.</p>

        <h3>Quantum Algorithms</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">While working at Rigetti Quantum Computing as a Junior Quantum Engineer Intern, I helped to develop quantum algorithms using their open source platform Forest. I helped to implement algorithms such as Shor's algorithm, amplitude amplification, the quantum Fourier transform, superdense coding, and more.</p>

        <p class="proj-caption">In part to teach others about quantum computers, my friend <a target="_blank"  href="http://joelin0.github.io">Joe</a> and I built bloch-js, a simple JavaScript plugin for an interactive Bloch sphere. Using three.js, the applet features pannable interactions, arbitrary rotations, precession tracing, and data set simulation.</p>

        <h3>QStudio</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">In an attempt to make quantum programming easier for beginners, I began developing a quantum circuit IDE and learning resource, called QStudio. I did not get the time to finish this project yet, but it current allows for selecting and dropping Hadamard gates onto a circuit, adding extra qubits to this circuit, and also features a text editor for eventually editing .qasm and .quil code.</p>

    <div class="col span_1_of_3 proj-box" id="battlecode">
        <h3>Battlecode</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">Battlecode is MIT's longest running programming competition, with a new game developed every year. With over 3000 participants (which includes high school students, undergraduates, graduates, and international students), the competition requires the use of AI and strategy to beat another team at a certain task. My role as a developer on the team (after competing for a year as a participant) has been developing a new website and helping to plan the competition.</p>

        <h3>ErrorCode</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">ErrorCode is a code testing platform built during HackMIT 2016. The platform allows users to upload snippets of code which other users can write tests for, in a gamified way. Test cases are upvoted, and users win points based on their test reputation.</p>

        <p class="proj-caption">Using TensorFlow, my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://cepp.ch/">Cooper</a> and I built a website powered by TensorFlow to scrape data from Devpost, a popular hackathon hosting website. After parsing this data with a beefy AWS instance, we were able to predict and view the probability of winning a hackathon based on the number of team members, technologies used, etc...</p>

        <h3>Highlights</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">Highlights is an Android application that I worked on with my friends <a href="https://cepp.ch/" target="_blank">Cooper</a> and Ali at YHack 2016. The application utilizes a machine learning backend which parses recently missed videos from your YouTube subscriptions to provide 10-30 second "summary" clips of that video. These small clips of relevant information are then displayed in a Snapchat-like way.</p>

        <h3>FancySlider</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">While working on a fitness application, I needed a weight and height slider which had ticks, much like a ruler. I couldn't find any that fit my needs, so I made my own! My custom view is highly customizable (change the color, tick heights, width, precision, etc...), and is also quite efficient since it uses a RecyclerView to hold the slider components. The library can be easily imported as a Gradle / Maven dependency.</p>
