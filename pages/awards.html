<h2>Hackathon Awards</h2>
<div class="section group">
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	<h3 class="hack-title">YHack 2016</h3>
        <p class="hack-award">2nd Place + AE Award</p>
        <p class="hack-desc">Highlights is an Android application that I worked on with my friends <a href="https://cepp.ch/" target="_blank">Cooper</a> and Ali at YHack 2016. The application utilizes a machine learning backend which parses recently missed videos from your YouTube subscriptions to provide 10-30 second "summary" clips of that video. These small clips of relevant information are then displayed in a Snapchat-like way. For this we won second place, as well as a challenge for the best entertainment application.</p>

        <p class="hack-award">Best Use of AWS</p>
        <p class="hack-desc">Using TensorFlow, my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://cepp.ch/">Cooper</a> and I built a website powered by TensorFlow to scrape data from Devpost, a popular hackathon hosting website. After parsing this data with a beefy AWS instance, we were able to predict and view the probability of winning a hackathon based on the number of team members, technologies used, and more. For this we won the Best Use of AWS award.</p>
