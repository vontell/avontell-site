<h2>Papers, Publications, and Essays</h2>
<p id="paper-intro">Below is a collection of my papers, publications, and essays. These are either related to my research or classes, and sometimes my personal interests. Papers in the "unpublished" section are simply summaries of my work, and do not represent the work or opinions of the secondary authors.</p><br />

<h2>Unpublished Papers / Summaries</h2>

<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="../papers/utility.pdf">Utility programs for nitrogen-vacancy center identification and initialization analysis</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Aaron Vontell, Michael Walsh, Eric Wadkins, Dirk Englund</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">Here we present an automated tool utilizing TensorFlow to train and classify spectra scans to determine if the scan is characteristic of a nitrogen-vacancy center (NV). We also present a process using ARTIQ to determine characteristics of our NV initialization, determined by photon counts.

<p class="pub-info"><em>Aaron Vontell, Michael Walsh, Dirk Englund</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">Here we present a suite of tools for real time quantum information processingusing ARTIQ, for the purpose of generating pulse sequences and echoing input signals in thecontext of Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond.
