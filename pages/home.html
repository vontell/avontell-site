<p id="home-intro">Welcome to my website!</p>

<p id="about-me-home">I'm Aaron Vontell, a senior currently studying Computer Science at MIT. I'm interested in pretty much anything related to computer science; quantum programming, web development, Android programming, accessibility on the web, automation, complexity theory, graphic and UI design, etc... In my free time I like to work on my own personal projects, do research for my labs, and watch movies. Click on the links to the left to learn more!</p>
