        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p id="resume-intro"><b>Purpose: </b> I am a consumer-oriented, versatile software developer, with focuses on both web development, mobile development, and quantum programming. I enjoy building products and designing systems in a way such that end-users and consumers can easily use them.</p>
        <p id="resume-caption"><b>Ideal Plan: </b> My ideal job and career path is to become a manager / director of products which focus on quantum programming in the real world (think Head of Software at a quantum computing company). Ideally this would involve the planning of quantum cloud services, quantum compilers, learning resources, and interactive interfaces such that consumers can use the service.</p><br />
