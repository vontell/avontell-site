<h2>Annabelle: Creation</h2>
<p class="blog-caption">One of the creepiest movies I have ever seen.</p>
<p class="blog-byline">Written by Aaron Vontell on August 13, 2017</p>

<p>As a prequel to the incredible Conjuring series, I personally felt that Sandberg had a lot to live up to. It's tough making movies in the genre of horror, and most usually fail to make the cut. However, Annabelle: Creation certainly made it.</p>

<p>I have to admit, this is probably the creepiest scary movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. It's difficult coming up with new techniques that steer away from the typical horror movie tropes; a scary figure appears in the mirror, a scary face behind a character, etc... However, this movie featured some terrifying parts which I have never seen before (I found the puppets to be reaaalllyyy creepy), and had me shielding my eyes almost every second of the film.</p>

<p>On top of those techniques, this movie was different from the others in the Conjuring universe; the scares were almost constant, and they were much more direct. The filmmakers will usually wait a while to show you the evil lurking within the possessed items, but Sandberg barely hesitated to bring the creepiest monster I've seen to the front stage.</p>

<p>Overall, this movie is different from the rest, and brings well crafted frights and creepiness in an interesting way. I would highly recommend seeing Annabelle: Creation if you are in for a fright.</p>

<h2>The Dark Tower</h2>
<p class="blog-caption">Went in with high hopes, left with crushed dreams.</p>
<p class="blog-byline">Written by Aaron Vontell on August 12, 2017</p>

<p>When I heard that The Dark Tower was in the process of being turned into a movie, and that it would include Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, I was ecstatic; the movies created from King's stories are usually pretty fantastic (The Shawshank Redemption, Misery, and Stand By Me all come to mind), and I was quite confident that this movie would be no exception.</p>

<p>In preparation I began to read the series, knowing full well that I wouldn't be able to get through all seven before the movie came out. However, I got through the first two (The Gunslinger and The Drawing of the Three), and became even more excited; the books were great! August finally rolled around and I went to my local AMC to witness the action for myself.</p>

<p>By the end of the movie, I was disappointed that I saw the movie; it didn't really relate to anything within the books as I saw, and the lack of backstory which is present within the books made the movie characters look weak. Don't get me wrong, the movie was full of great action and interesting moments (most of which are seen in the trailer), but after coming from such high expectations, I really let myself down on this one. The plot was weak, the feelings between Roland and the man in black were not explained well, and the ending was too fast.</p>

<p>If you have no interest in reading the books by Stephen King, I would recommend seeing this movie for cheap action thrills and a small sense of adventure. Otherwise, I would highly recommend reading the series instead, which will have you at the edge of your seat for the entire ride.</p>
